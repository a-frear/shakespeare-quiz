        question: 'Which one of Shakespeare‚Äôs female characters has the most lines?',
        answers: [
          'Rosalind in "As You Like It"',
          'Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet"',
          'Cleopatra in "Anthony and Cleopatra"',
          'Portia in "Merchant of Venice"'
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'Rosalind in "As You Like It"',
        explanation: 'Rosalind is Shakespeare‚Äôs biggest female role, with 685 lines, compared with Cleopatra‚Äôs 678, Portia‚Äôs 574 and Juliet‚Äôs 542. Romeo has more lines (617) than Juliet... which may have something to do with Juliet pretending to be dead for part of the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearean character with 1,506 (he has a lot he is trying to figure out!). Since As You Like It was written right before Hamlet, a lot of comparisons have been drawn between the characters of Rosalind and the Danish prince.'

        question: 'What did Shakespeare leave his wife in his will?',
        answers: [
          'His manuscripts',
          'Half his money',
          'His dog',
          'His second-best bed'
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'His second-best bed',
        explanation: 'Since Shakespeare did spend most of his life in London away from his wife Anne, its easy to think this may have been a slight. But the best bed was regarded as "an heirloom piece," to be passed to an heir rather than a spouse. It is also likely that the best bed would have been reserved for guests, meaning the ‚Äúsecond-best‚Äù was the bed that William and Anne shared. Shakespeare died at home with his family in Stratford-upon-Avon when he was 52 years old.'

        question: 'Which of these plays were not written during an outbreak of the plague?',
        answers: [
          'King Lear',
          'Hamlet',
          'Anthony and Cleopatra',
          'Macbeth'
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'Hamlet',
        explanation: 'King Lear, Macbeth, and Anthony and Cleopatra were all written in 1606, during a bad outbreak of the Bubonic plague. All the theaters were shut down, so maybe Shakespeare had more time to spend writing.'

      {

          'King',
          'Sun'
        ],

She performed in Henry IV and said of her role: "I had Dick the butcher‚Äôs part, with the famous line, ‚ÄòFirst thing we do, let‚Äôs kill all the lawyers.‚Äô And then I asked if I could ad-lib an addition, I checked this out in advance, and the addition was, \'and next the reporters.\'"'
