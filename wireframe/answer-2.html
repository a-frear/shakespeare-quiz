            <p id="explanation">Rosalind is Shakespeare’s biggest female role, with 685 lines, compared with Cleopatra’s 678, Portia’s 574 and Juliet’s 542. Romeo has more lines (617) than Juliet... which may have something to do with Juliet pretending to be dead for part of the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearean character with 1,506 (he has a lot he is trying to figure out!). Since As You Like It was written right before Hamlet, a lot of comparisons have been drawn between the characters of Rosalind and the Danish prince.</p>
